# Ollama Web

Ollama Web is a web-based interface for interacting with the Ollama model. This README will guide you through setting up and running the project on both Windows and Linux systems.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to download and set up **Ollama** on your system.


### 1. Download and Install Ollama

### For Windows Users:
1. Visit the [Ollama download page](https://ollama.com/download) for Windows.
2. Download the Windows installer and run it.
3. Follow the installation instructions to complete the process.

### For Linux Users:
1. Open your terminal and run the following command to install Ollama:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | bash
   ```

2. After installation, verify that Ollama is installed successfully by running:

   ```bash
   ollama --version
   ```

### 2. Install Required Python Packages

Once Ollama is installed, you need to install the necessary Python packages to run the project.

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to keep dependencies isolated:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - **On Windows:**
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On Linux/Mac:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 3. Clone the Repository

To get the code, you need to clone the `ollama-web` repository from GitHub. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shekharP1536/ollama-web.git
cd ollama-web
```

### 4. Run the Application

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and run the `index.py` script to start the web application:

```bash
python index.py
```

### 5. Access the Application

Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

This will open the Ollama Web interface, and you can start using it locally!
